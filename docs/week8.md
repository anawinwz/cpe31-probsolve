### Weekly problems
The following problems can all be directly approached. No special algorithms are needed.

Problem | Topics/Data Structure | Remark
--- | --- | ---
syllables | Loop through String | 
grass | 2D Array, Loop Control | N = 100 for Case 7,9,10
catmario | Array, Min Finding |
toinfinity | Math., Min-Max Finding |
editor | Vector | Invalid Delete function can make Case 5-10 wrong.
